      <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>
      <p>Thinking about a moral dilemma that I had been in was a little bit of a strange undertaking. I donâ€™t see myself as a big protagonist or someone that flagships any great moral battles. As I thought further, I realized that people make ethical decisions every day. The food you eat, the clothes you wear, transportation, how you vote, how you treat the people around you, the list goes on and on. If you overanalyze it enough, every single decision you make influences something or someone, and therefore a moral string attached to it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After a couple days of pondering, I finally descended from space and finally managed to zoom into an event where did have to make a moral decision. It wasnâ€™t a very interesting, or very impactful in the grand scheme. But I think it highlights a moral value that I hold strongly, of fairness and equity.</p>

      <p>At a previous job in hospo, there was a bit of tension between two colleagues that were brothers. One older was a my manager at the time, and the younger other worked alongside me behind the bar. The older brother loved to catch the younger doing things wrong and making an example out of him. It got to the point where it was more than just petty work drama, there was obviously some childhood beef/trauma being unearthed in the workplace. It wouldâ€™ve been very easy for me to say nothing. I had been working there long enough that I was smart enough and competent enough to fly under that radar (plus I was planning on resigning to come study here). Long story short, I spoke up. The younger brother appreciated that someone had noticed what was going on, the whole business was a little bit of a family affair.</p>
      <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>

      <p>I grew up surrounded by a business environment in sunny Gisborne. My parents did eventually get sick of me and decided to ship me away to an all boys boarding school. Both environments were monumental in shaping me into the person I am today.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Growing up in a business environment taught me a lot and gave me a unique perspective. One of the things that stood out to me was my fatherâ€™s ability to always be prepared. Every system in the business required some level of competency or experience, and he knew it all. Its likely that this level of preparedness came from years of experience, or maybe it was just in his blood (the business was passed down from his father after all). Whatever the reason it was something that I admired and something that while not in the exact circumstances, is something that I try and emulate today. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I really valued the years I spent at boarding school. The teachers and boarding staff were tough but fair. Keeping 250 boys under control couldnâ€™t have been easy, and this meant there were strict rules and routines that were put in place. I can remember times where it felt like the world was absolutely crumbling around me because of a new rule or system put in place. It was probably plenty of group think, its always easy to complain. Boarding school instilled in me the value of fairness, even if it doesnâ€™t make everyone happy. In hindsight, the rules and routines in place shaped who I am today and I am very grateful for it.</p>

      <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
      <p>Critical thinking, perseverance and attention to detail. Particularly when using trial and error. </p>
      <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>My biggest weakness is self starting. I can struggle at times to begin working on a new topic due to self-doubt, and second guessing myself. Once I begin, I can find myself getting lost for hours on something I as let a flow state take over. Putting myself In the right headspace as well as physical space is a good strategy I have learned to alleviate the drawback.</p>

      <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
      <p>One of the (few) times that I felt proud in my previous work place when another co-worker and I redesigned the stock transfer forms. Long process short we changed them from what was in essence, just a large printed out spreadsheet to something much more legible, less prone to mistakes and able to adapt to new products being released.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The tension came from managements unwillingness to change or update its system, despite the constant stock quantity discrepancies. Asking for a change proved ineffective. The solution came when we adjusted our strategy, we did it ourselves.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you want something done right, do it yourself.</p>
