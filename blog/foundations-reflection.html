      <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>

        Foundations was a learning experience for me for sure! The proportion of content based on â€˜softâ€™ skills versus â€˜hardâ€™ skills was certainly more heavily weighted in the direction of soft skills compared to what I was expecting. The first couple of weeks of foundations where the tech content was most simple gave me valuable time to adjust to the core content of the course.

        There were several things that I learned about myself during core learning. I learned that with consistency and the right mindset, I can achieve a lot. Working on tech skills for 40 hours a week gave me to absorb the content to the best of my ability. That paired with a positive can-do attitude and my new knowledge about neuroplasticity gave me the tools to exceed my expectations. Before dev academy, self-reflection was exclusively done internally, externalizing those thoughts and feelings was a completely new experience. I learned that not only do I have the ability to do that, but doing externalizing thoughts is a great way to gain clarity and organize said thoughts.

        Empathy and self-awareness play an integral role in programming. Programming is something that is more often that not done in teams. Having empathy and self-awareness allows you to work effectively with others because it gives you the ability to see how others are feeling. Being empathic about others feelings and self-aware of your own is key to success when working with others. The other reason values, empathy and self-awareness are valuable to coding is that a lot of programs are ultimately created for others to use. High levels of empathy allow you to better understand the end user and cater a program to fit their needs and wants.

        The biggest surprise for me was the transformation of my attitude towards the core content. Early on, the core content was the most challenging aspect of the course for me. I always recognized the value in the content, but engaging with it and discussing it was difficult. I had the attitude of seeing it as a necessary hurdle that needed to be conquered to reach the good stuff, the tech content. As the weeks progressed, I found myself engaging more with the core content, and valuing it highly. My ability to externalize my organic thoughts in blog form became easier. This made the process less wounding, and hopefully the content of my blogs more engaging!

        Programming is so much more than writing code, I have come to learn. Dev Academy focusing on core content just as much tech content for this very reason. Employers arenâ€™t just looking for the best coders, they are looking for someone that works well with others, and will make a good cultural fit to their team. The focus of core content gives us the skills we need to stand out and be employable. Research shows that up to 80% of success in the workplace is the result of emotional intelligence. The core content taught increases our emotional intelligence, giving us the edge we need.

        The core content is definitely not a waste of time. Hindside is always 20/20. The core content has been absolutely invaluable so far, and I canâ€™t see that changing going forward. Better understanding of core concepts early in our learning journey will pay dividends well into the future by  making us more effective learners. Better understanding of the way the brain works allows you to learn new concepts more efficiently.  Understanding concepts such as empathy and self-awareness will allow us to work with others better.

        Just like Abe Lincoln and the tree, we could spend more time chopping the tree. But we should probably sharpen the axe first!
