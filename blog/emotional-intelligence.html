      <h1>EQ vs IQ</h1> 
    </div> 
    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <p>Emotional Intelligence (IQ) and Intelligent Quotient (EQ) are two important skills to have in life as well as the workplace. Intelligence quotient test for your ability to solve logical problems and to recognize patterns. Emotional intelligence on the other hand is a measure of your ability to read and measure your own emotions and well as the emotions of others.</p>
      <br>
      <p>For a lot of people, including myself, the measure of an individualâ€™s intelligence is often biased towards intelligence quota. Using traditional measures of intelligence such as standardized testing, those with superior IQ score far above their peers. The greater ability to recognize patterns and solve logical based problems give those individuals an edge on the type of testing often seen in schools and universities. It is easy to see where this bias may come from. Most people spend a large proportion of their early development in these types of environments. Seeing those with higher IQ score higher than others in these conditions is a fair reason to develop the bias that IQ is the all-encompassing measure of oneâ€™s intelligence.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Intelligence quotient is not enough if we want to be successful in life. Contrary to the belief of many, research has shown that our success in the workplace and in life is largely down to Emotional Intelligence (EQ). Some research puts the bias on EQ for success as high as 80%. Those with high emotional intelligence can read and measure othersâ€™ emotions, as well as read and regulate their own.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With the development of EQ, comes the ability to read and measure oneâ€™s emotions. This gives someone the knowledge of what they are feeling, and why they are feeling this way. Greater understanding of this allows us to be better equipped when navigating emotional situations. With the understanding of why we are feeling a certain type of way, you are able to avoid being overwhelmed by emotions.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When I think about a highly emotionally intelligent person, I think about the Hawkeâ€™s Bay sales rep at my previous job. Every interaction that I had with this person was positive and productive. Although we unfortunately werenâ€™t involved directly, I felt as though what I was saying was being listened to. This thought was echoed by co-workers, who found them an absolute delight to work with. </p>
