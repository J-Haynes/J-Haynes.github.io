      <p class="blogpost">Classes and IDs are two very important aspects of web design that allow you to apply rules and styles to elements on your website. Rather than going through each individual element in a page one by one, html elements can be assigned classes and IDs to apply formatting styling to a large number of elements. Two of the same HTML element (for example, two h1 elements) can be displayed differently, depending on the class or ID they were assigned. The use of classes and IDs allows for efficient and flexible web design.

      <blockquote>An ID can be applied to one element only.</blockquote>
      <p class="blogpost">An ID can be applied to one element only. You apply an ID to a unique element that has unique aesthetics or a unique purpose. When using CSS to apply styling to an ID, styling is applied to that single element only. An easy way that I use to remember this is to relate them to identification in real life. Every person has their own unique identity that is unlike anyone else, HTML elements with IDs are the same! IDs use the `#` prefix in CSS to select the ID you want.</p>
