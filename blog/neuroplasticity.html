      <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

        Neuroplasticity is the concept that the human brain can modify its neural connections in response to new experiences, new ideas, and changes in environment. The brain is constantly looking to form new neural pathways, giving us the ability to learn new ideas. It is a relatively new idea that challenges the belief that the brain grows until a certain age and will remain unchanged onwards. The new model of a dynamic, ever changing brain, has transformed the way we think about learning, especially later in life.

        For me, the discovery of neuroplasticity has a lot to do with attitude. Its not like with the discovery of neuroplasticity caused the brain became malleable and adaptable overnight! The brain has always had the ability to change to its environment, but the scientific backing of neuroplasticity removes the ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt learn that‚Äù excuse. The spread of the idea of neuroplasticity gives people the belief to adapt a growth mindset. Before they might have thought that they were dealt a bad hand, that they couldn‚Äôt change things, because that‚Äôs how things are! Armed with the knowledge the brain can form new connection, people can approach new situations and experiences with a more positive, ‚Äúcan do‚Äù, attitude.

        You can use the idea of neuroplasticity in your day to day life as well in learning. I like to recall experiences in the past where something was completely new to me, and with repetition became more and more familiar. I had this exact experience learning JavaScript. JavaScript was a foreign language to me, none of it made sense. As I worked on it every day for weeks, slowly new connections formed in my brain. Concepts that I was completely lost on initially, became second nature to me. I wasn‚Äôt aware of it at the time,  but neurons on my brain were constantly trying to form new connections. Going forward, I can recall my experience with JavaScript and apply that understanding to learning concepts in the future.

        I had always heard the saying that ‚ÄúYour mind if not fully developed until you‚Äôre 25‚Äù. While it is just saying that you hear, using the phrases ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù and ‚Äúnot developed‚Äù implies a starting point and ending point. It also implies that brain development is very one dimensional. Now that I am equipped with the knowledge of neuroplasticity, I can approach that saying with a level of nuance. I know that anyone is capable of changing their brain, changing the way they  think, in response to learning. I think this information will give me the tools I need to approach my learning journey with a positive, growth mindset that will set me up for success.

        ‚ÄúYour mind is not fully developed until you‚Äôre 25, but its also very capable of forming new neural pathways far beyond that‚Äù is my new saying. Not sure if it will catch on though.

        The tweet below fascinated me. You can see new connections that are being formed!
