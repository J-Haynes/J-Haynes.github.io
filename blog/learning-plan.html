      <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>My longterm goal is to find a job within the tech space that gives me purpose, is motivating to turn up to everyday and will give me the remuneration to give me options in life.</p>
      <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
      <p>My strengths include my ability to critically think about things. I am great at making prior connections with past knowledge and experiences to form new ideas. 
        My limitations include a level of self doubt. This can limit my ability to get the ball rolling in an area that I may have otherwise excelled in or enjoyed.
        </p>
      <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>I would love to be more of a self starter. I think that I can be very productive when I am doing a task, however it can sometimes difficult for me to start
        A mixture of internal and external motivation is key to this I feel.
        </p>
      <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
        <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
        <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I pride myself on being an active and effective listener. When working with others I am able to listen to others wants and needs and come to a reasonable compromise or solution. 
        My first port of call when things are overwhelming is very simple, I take a break. Sometimes when you step away from the thing that is causing you grief, the solution comes to you magically! A break can calm me down and put me in the right mindset to overcome whats in front of me. When things get too much, I love to exercise. For years now, exercise has been something I have been very passionate about. It has transformed into a staple in my life that provides stability, structure, routine and an weird form of therapy. 
        Help being a discord message away has been helpful. I am committed to continue to seek help when I am in need. There is nothing worse than being stuck on something or ages that can be fixed easily.
        </p>
      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>I have great faith that the facilitation team will provide me with the support I need to succeed. I thrive in a positive and productive environment that gives me the tools and external motivation to be productive and flourish.</p>
      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
      <p>During foundations, I am trying my best to emulate the bootcamp structure. This means an approximately 40 hour work week, and a 90 minute lunch break. During that lunch break I like to exercise.
        Along with resting, I also try to make my weekends productive. Catching up on things like meal prep, laundry, tidying my living area set me up for success during my week days.
